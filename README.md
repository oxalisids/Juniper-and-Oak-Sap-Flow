    These datasets were collected using Thermal Dissipation Probes (TDP-30 model) and SapIP data loggers from Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX. 
    The data have the following columns:
        
        Date          Date 
        Time          Time
        V batt        Voltage of battery powering data logger
        dVT1 - dVT6   Six channels that contain the temperature differential data from individual trees, in mV. 
        
    Refer to the tree tables to understand which channel corresponds to which tree.
